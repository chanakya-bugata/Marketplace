7. **Data Analytics**: What level of business intelligence and analytics should be provided to vendors and administrators?

8. **Compliance**: Are there specific regulatory compliance requirements (GDPR, PCI DSS) that need to be addressed?

9. **Scalability**: What are the expected growth projections and should we plan for horizontal scaling from the beginning?

10. **Third-party Integrations**: Which third-party services (CRM, email marketing, accounting) should have built-in integrations?
